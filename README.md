# House Price Prediction

**Overview: House Price Prediction and Recommendation System**

The House Price Prediction and Recommendation System is a comprehensive tool designed to assist users in estimating the price range of houses based on specific input parameters and to recommend suitable properties based on their preferences. 

**Key Features:**

1. **Price Prediction Model**: The core functionality of the system is a machine learning-based model that predicts the price range of houses. The model takes into account various factors such as location, size, amenities, and historical sales data to provide accurate estimates.

2. **Input Interface**: Users can input specific details about the house they are interested in, including location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage, and any additional features. 

3. **Visualization**: The system offers visualization tools to display key features of the surrounding society, including amenities, nearby schools, hospitals, and transportation hubs. This helps users gain insights into the neighborhood before making a decision.

4. **Recommendation Engine**: Based on the user's input and preferences, the system leverages a recommendation engine to suggest houses that match their criteria. It considers factors such as budget, location preferences, and desired amenities to provide personalized recommendations.

**Benefits:**

- **Accuracy**: The predictive model provides accurate estimates of house prices, helping users make informed decisions.
- **Convenience**: The recommendation system simplifies the house-hunting process by suggesting relevant properties based on the user's preferences.
- **Insights**: Visualization tools offer valuable insights into the neighborhood and surrounding area, aiding users in understanding the local environment.

**Future Enhancements:**

- Integration with real-time data sources to ensure up-to-date information.
- Incorporation of user feedback to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
- Expansion of visualization features to include more detailed information about the neighborhood.

Overall, the House Price Prediction and Recommendation System serves as a valuable tool for individuals seeking to buy or sell a house, providing them with the information and guidance needed to make informed decisions in the real estate market.


## Data Cleaning 

The data cleaning phase of the project focuses on preparing the raw datasets for further analysis and modeling. This involves several key steps:

1. **Loading Data**: The process begins with loading the raw CSV files containing data on flats and houses into Pandas DataFrames.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values within the datasets are identified and addressed using appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal of rows/columns.

3. **Data Transformation**: Data transformation techniques are applied to ensure consistency and accuracy. This includes converting data types, standardizing units, and encoding categorical variables.

4. **Removing Outliers**: Outliers, if present, are detected and removed to prevent them from adversely affecting the analysis or modeling process.

5. **Feature Engineering**: New features may be derived from existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. This involves creating interaction terms, polynomial features, or aggregating existing features.

6. **Data Integration**: Once the individual datasets are cleaned, they are merged to create a unified dataset containing details of both flats and houses. This merged dataset serves as the input for further analysis and modeling.

The data cleaning process ensures that the datasets are consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis, laying the foundation for the subsequent stages of the project.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase of the project involves a detailed examination of the cleaned dataset to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships between variables. This phase encompasses the following key steps:

1. **Detailed Analysis of Each Column**: Each column of the dataset is thoroughly examined to understand its distribution, central tendency, variability, and potential outliers. Descriptive statistics and visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are utilized to summarize and visualize the data.

2. **Interpretation of Important Information**: Important information extracted from the dataset during the analysis phase is interpreted to identify significant trends, patterns, and correlations. This includes identifying key features that have a strong influence on house prices or are indicative of certain characteristics.

3. **Feature Selection for Model Training**: Based on the insights gained from the analysis, a subset of relevant features is selected for model training. Features that exhibit a strong correlation with the target variable (house prices) or demonstrate significant predictive power are prioritized for inclusion in the model.

4. **Conversion of Numerical Columns to Categorical**: Some numerical columns may be converted to categorical variables if they represent discrete categories or ordinal values. This conversion facilitates the incorporation of these variables into the modeling process and may improve the interpretability of the model.

5. **In-depth Analysis**: In addition to examining individual variables, the EDA phase involves exploring relationships between multiple variables through bivariate and multivariate analysis. Correlation matrices, pair plots, and heatmaps are used to visualize correlations and dependencies between variables.

The EDA phase plays a crucial role in uncovering insights from the data and guiding subsequent modeling decisions. By thoroughly analyzing the dataset and interpreting key findings, we can develop a deeper understanding of the factors influencing house prices and build more effective predictive models.
