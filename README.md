# House Price Prediction and Recommendation System

## Overview

The House Price Prediction and Recommendation System is a comprehensive tool designed to assist users in estimating house prices and recommending suitable properties based on their preferences. It encompasses various features and functionalities to streamline the house-hunting process and provide valuable insights into the real estate market.

## Key Features

1. **Price Prediction Model**: Utilizes machine learning to predict house prices based on input parameters such as location, size, and amenities.
2. **Input Interface**: Allows users to input specific details about the house they are interested in.
3. **Visualization**: Offers visualization tools to display key features of surrounding societies, amenities, and neighborhood information.
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Recommends properties based on user preferences, considering factors such as budget, location, and amenities.

## Benefits

- **Accuracy**: Provides accurate estimates of house prices, aiding users in making informed decisions.
- **Convenience**: Simplifies the house-hunting process by suggesting relevant properties based on user preferences.
- **Insights**: Offers valuable insights into the neighborhood and surrounding areas, enhancing user understanding.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real-time data sources for up-to-date information.
- Incorporation of user feedback to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Expansion of visualization features to include more detailed neighborhood information.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning phase involves preparing raw datasets for analysis by addressing missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies. Key steps include loading data, handling missing values, data transformation, outlier detection and treatment, feature engineering, and data integration.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase explores the cleaned dataset to gain insights into patterns and relationships between variables. It includes detailed analysis of each column, interpretation of important information, feature selection for model training, conversion of numerical columns to categorical, and in-depth analysis through bivariate and multivariate analysis.

## Model Training and Optimization

This phase involves training and optimizing various machine learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, and more. It includes feature encoding, feature engineering with PCA, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The best-performing model, Random Forest, achieved an accuracy of 0.9026 with specific hyperparameters.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization tasks include generating word clouds of societies, maps of sector areas vs. price charts, BHK pie charts for all sectors, side-by-side comparisons of BHK, and plots comparing houses and flats. These visualizations provide insights into property distribution, pricing trends, and property types.

## Recommender System

The recommender system allows users to search for localities based on location and radius and recommends related sectors based on similarity scores. This enhances user experience by providing tailored recommendations and insights into nearby localities and related sectors.
